These projects were from the Data Structure and Algorithms class that I took at De Anza College. These programs were not used the standard library of C++. This repository represents the application of software engineer techniques to the design and development of large programs, data abstraction and structures and associated algorithms: stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables; internal and external sorting; use of recursion; team project.
